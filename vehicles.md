## Tortoises

In the late 1940's and early 1950's, Cyberneticist Grey Walter pioneered the engineering of autonomous agents, as early examples of self-directed robots, with his series of *tortoises*.

Remarkably, this direction of research was largely forgotten as efforts in artificial intelligence concentrated on symbolic thinking. A brief history [can be read here](http://www.rutherfordjournal.org/article020101.html) -- but the story of Walter and other British Cyberneticians is truly fascinating; I highly recommend Andrew Pickering's account in [The Cybernetic Brain](http://press.uchicago.edu/ucp/books/book/chicago/C/bo8169881.html). This wasn't just random tinkering, there was an explicit agenda of understanding human and machine together.

Walter's tortoises have inspired many great research products of the last century, including:

- the **turtle graphics** of Logo, which might be before your time, but initiated a whole generation of children into computer programming decades ago and led to LEGO Mindstorms among other things,
- the **situated robotics** of Rodney Brooks (which you may know of as the "iRobot" vaccuum cleaner), 
- the **flocking simulations** of Craig Reynolds (which you have seen in hundreds of films, games, etc.), 
- digital artworks, notably [Casey Reas' Tissue series](https://reas.com/tissue_p/)
- the ever-resurgent waves of **Cybernetics**, including Valentino Braitenberg's Vehicles (which we will look at in more depth now).

## Vehicles

> A Braitenberg vehicle is an agent that can autonomously move around. It has primitive sensors (measuring some stimulus at a point) and wheels (each driven by its own motor) that function as actuators or effectors. A sensor, in the simplest configuration, is directly connected to an effector, so that a sensed signal immediately produces a movement of the wheel. Depending on how sensors and wheels are connected, the vehicle exhibits different behaviors (which can be goal-oriented).  [wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Braitenberg_vehicle)

[Braitenberg, V. (1984). Vehicles: Experiments in synthetic psychology. Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/vehicles)

> Cyberneticist Valentino Braitenberg argues that his extraordinarily simple mechanical vehicles manifest behaviors that appear identifiable as fear, aggression, love, foresight, and optimism. The vehicle idea was a thought experiment conceived to show that complex, apparently purposive behaviour did not need to depend on complex representations of the environment inside a creature or agents brain. In fact simply by reacting to the environment in a consistent manner was more than enough to explain the low level reactive behaviours exhibited by many animals.

This book is quite short, but richly dense. There's a copy of Ch1-6 in our Teams Readings folder.

Vehicles have also been constructed in hardware of course // see examples [here](http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~conradt/research/BraitenbergVehicle/), [here](http://blog.electricbricks.com/en/2010/05/vehiculos-braitenberg-nxt-g/), [here](http://tinkerlog.com/2009/06/07/mini-braitenberg-vehicle/).

- Prompts! See if you can either 
	- a) Extend our vehicles code into later models from the book
	- b) Find a way to blend work from last week with the vehicles model
