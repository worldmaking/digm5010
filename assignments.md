# Assignments

## Self-Introduction

Please add 2-4 slides to [The Google Slide deck here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/12pSOctt3mEv9KZjOAu7Ljw756xhFN8wrI0l20V1Xx7c/edit?usp=sharing) to introduce yourself. 
- I suggest a brief (~100 words) of your background and the key words/ideas/questions for your work, with representative images/video etc. 
- You can include a more formal bio, or artist statement, or something more informal about the inspirations that brought you to the program.
- Remember to include your name, and reference details (name, link etc.) for any images or media you add.
- Please be careful not to delete your colleague's slides!

## Online Journal

You will create a website as your journal. You can use github pages for example to host this.

Every week, please post an update on your journal, capturing the work you have been doing. The journal as a whole will serve as a documentation of your development in the course. For practice based work, posts should include video, screenshots, embedded scripts, links to github code, or some other concete material. Posts don't need to be long, but should focus on key questions and/or insights discovered along the way. What surprised you? Did you surprise yourself? What are the key challenges you found? We will bring these into the discussion every week. 

As the course progresses, this journal will capture your progress in development towards the major assignments, which will also be added to the journal. 

### Practice Studies

I recommend posting practice studies each week onto your journal. Every week I will share some prompts for these studies. These studies can be relatively simple but should demonstrate something you have learned or document an investigation you have made. Make, make make!

- What would be a generator of *interesting* random programs? (What does *interesting* mean to you?)
- [See the sketch prompts here](sketches.html)


## Literature Review.

Consider this year's DCA curatorial themes of [**Invisibility :: Complexity :: Resistance :: Intentionality**](pdf/DCA_theme_2020-2021.pdf), responding to this time in pandemia. 

1. You will investigate a **topic** that ideally intersects least one of these themes with something of value to your own research goals. Good research always begins by seeking out key papers and other relevant research resources. Some investigative tips:
  - Use Wikipedia to identify **keywords or terms**, questions and issues, foundational publications and controversies, etc. This can also help to make your search more narrow/specific. Look for the edges of a body of research. Wikipedia is an excellet network of conceptual nodes (but also a potential rabbithole). But remember that it is an encyclopedia, and should be used mainly as a guide map.
  - Use these terms and publications in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) and other academic search engines to find for papers that address the questions and issues. Follow `cited by` and `related articles` trails to find new leads. Aim to find the most significant (qualitatively & quantitatively) papers. You should be aiming for a collection of 25-50 potentially interesting papers on the topic at this point. 
  - At the same time, look for conferences or journals that are more specific to your topic, and see if they have collections of proceedings online to browse through. 
  - Not all papers are available as PDFs online. You might be able to find them via [York Libraries](https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/bbl/e-resources/) or also communities like [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), but do not let this roadblock your progress -- find alternatives to work from instead.
  - At this point you may be able to formulate a first draft of a title of the topic or area, perhaps even a key question or problem statement. 
2. Collect this list as a **Reading List**, formatted with MLA, APA or Chicago style as you prefer (but keep it consistent) -- again, Scholar can help source these, but be aware that not all entries are complete. Any non-academic/non-paper references may need special citation styles (e.g. URLs, published films or audio recordings, etc.)
3. From this reading list, select 8-12 of them to study in more careful detail as you create an **Annotated Bibliography**. 
  - Use skimming/speed reading and organization to identify those that are most interesting or most worthy of more detailed review; and which would constitute an adquate treatment of the topic. 
  - Aim for diversity. Avoid using the same authors for the majority of the selection. Include distinct and opposing viewpoints if possible. 
  - Use primary sources where possible (in particular avoid blog posts, news articles, etc.), unless the secondary source adds a significant new idea (in which case you may want to cite both).
  - Not everything has to be an academic paper, but ensure that at least 75% of your references are academic publications (conference articles, journal articles, etc.). 
  - See [York SPARK's guide to annotated bibliographies here](https://spark.library.yorku.ca/wp-content/themes/glendonits-spark-20151125/resources/Annotated%20Bibliography%20Overview.pdf). The annotation for each paper would be 100-400 words, making around 2500 words total.
4. Post the results into your journal:
  - The specific topic title or research question
  - The keywords or search terms
  - Your initial Reading List
  - Your final Annotated Bibliography
  - Any commentary on observations you found while researching the topic that are not specific to the papers -- in particular, did you find a "gap" in the treatment of the topic that could be an important avenue for your own work?


## Video Tutorial

Research is about *sharing*. Sometimes, that requires sharing *how*. 

1. Create a video-based tutorial (roughly 10-20mins) to introduce a technical topic.
	- It could be an introduction to a platform we are not covering in class
	- or an exploration of a library/API or SDK etc. available for one of our platforms
	- or alternatively, it could be a tutorial on a technique or algorithm or mechanism or a part of mathematics etc.
2. Whichever you choose, it should cover both of: 
	- introducing the key concepts, the unusual and interesting parts, and related work
	- deep-dive developing a demonstration (coding a sketch) from the ground up, explaining via voiceover what you are doing at each step and why. 
3. You are welcome to use any screen-recording tool. Zoom is OK, Camtasia is pretty fancy, OBS is very powerful. Whatever you use, I recommend doing a few takes. Sometimes the first take is the best, sometimes the third. You are welcome to edit them together if it makes sense. But don't lose time making it 'slick' -- that's not the point here. People like Dan Shiffman or 3Blue1Brown do make beautiful videos but the most important part is that they convey *what* is interesting/valuable/powerful/etc. about the technical system/tool/algorithm/etc by explaining *how* it works.  


## Final Paper

1. The topic of the paper can be developed from material earlier in the course, and/or refer to the curatorial themes of [**Invisibility :: Complexity :: Resistance :: Intentionality**](http://alicelab.world/digm5010/pdf/DCA_theme_2020-2021.pdf). You may document & contextualize your practice studies or one of your artworks. You could write a 'white paper' on a technique. You might re-implement a known research paper, and analyze the results. Or you might discuss more deeply ideas encountered in the bibliography. Perhaps pen a manifesto. 
  -  Find a few other papers online that have similar focus, and analyze their structure as a guide.
2. The format will be a very modern, online-first academic article. That is, one designed to be read online, with at least some active components, rather than primarily on paper. The notion of publishing in academia has been rapidly changing, and these changes are accelerating under pandemic conditions.
  - See [https://distill.pub]() for an example of a modern, web-based peer-reviewed journal with embedded visualizations and interactive components. 
  - See [https://jar-online.net]() for a different example more focused on art theory & practice.
  - We may develop a template in class, using github, github-pages, html5/css/js, markdown/pandoc, D3.js, webgl or similar. 
  - Nevertheless, the paper should meet academic standards of relevance, clarity of writing, structure, balanced and evidence-based argument, critical thinking, and appropriate level and kinds of academic references. 
3. Post your final paper online -- either inside or linked from your journal.
   - You should identify a conference/festival/other appropriate venue to submit your research or research-creation. For example:
     - [Art Machines 2](https://www.cityu.edu.hk/artmachines2/message-symposium-director), Deadline Dec 15.
