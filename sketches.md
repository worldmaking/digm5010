# Practice Session 1: Interfaces as instruments: From reactive graphics to audio-visual canvasses

What makes the screen different from paper? What makes the mouse different from a pen?

Here's a classic illustration of the graphical space of the screen as *reactive*: [Paul Haeberli's "Dynadraw"](http://www.graficaobscura.com/dyna/). There's a web-based port of this [here](http://www.rogerandwendy.com/roger/dynadraw/)

Take [John Maeda](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda), the designer & MIT Media Lab professor, who pioneered reactive graphics in the era of the Macintosh and CD-ROM. [Read a statement here](reading/JohnMaedaDigitalDesignTheory.pdf)

Key insights:

- the most interesting pixels on the screen are the mouse
- the mouse represents not just *space* but also *time* -- use it

Maeda's courses and research in the Aesthetics & Computation group at MIT inspired a whole generation of creative coders. His [Design By Numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_By_Numbers) software was the precursor of Processing (and thus P5.js). Maeda's courses challenged students to rethink the medium from its most basic elements. A typical assignment:

> Given a point in space over a finite rectangular area, create a parametric drawing that illustrates repetition, variety, or rhythm. [MAS 964 P](https://acg.media.mit.edu/courses/mas964/presentation/panels.html)

One of Maeda's students -- [Golan Levin](http://www.flong.com) -- now professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and a key figure in the Art & Code community. His [Masters's thesis](http://www.flong.com/texts/publications/thesis/) focused specifically on the creation of audiovisual instruments, responding directly to Maeda's project. 

For example, look at Curly and [Yellowtail](http://www.flong.com/texts/reports/report_yellowtail/).

- Making prompts: Mutate the code we built in class. 
  - See also the collection of interface-instruments at [SoundToys](http://www.soundtoys.net) or other apps like [Nodal](http://nodalmusic.com), [SoundDrop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=63FyqOMpORI) etc. Perhaps pick your favourite from these, and perhaps start trying to implement it, and we can take it further in class next week.
