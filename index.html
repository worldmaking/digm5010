<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> The purpose of Foundations is to equip and assist students to undertake graduate-level research in Digital Media. This means, being aware of the broad range of the field along with its nearer and farther histories (and implicated futures); being able to find, read, and understand the languages through which research is articulated (in theoretical and practical terms); being able to create work across of a broad range of digital media that is effective and/or innovative.</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>
<p>The purpose of <em>Foundations</em> is to equip and assist you to undertake <strong>graduate-level research</strong> in Digital Media. </p>
<p>The Digital Media graduate program&#39;s academic objectives include promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to computational art-making and technology development, providing students with 21st century “real-world” skills in tandem with research acumen. To work and conduct research in this area means skillfully bridging literacies in art, science and engineering practices. The goals of <em>Foundations</em> are therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>to learn the essential technical and methodological skills of graduate-level research in areas of digital media and computational arts</li>
<li>to attain literacy in mathematical, theoretical, and computational bases as they intersect with world of digital art-making,</li>
<li>to develop deep understanding and a real feel for computation as a creative medium.</li>
<li>to be able to adequately place one&#39;s research within a larger network of relations and lineages, and be able to articulate its relevance and identify its values in context.</li>
</ul>
<!-- 
- Being aware of the broad range of the field along with its nearer and farther histories (and implicated futures); 
- Being able to find, read, and understand the languages through which research is articulated (in theoretical and practical terms); 
- Being able to create work across of a broad range of digital media that is effective and/or innovative. 
-->

<p>Establishing these foundations is ultimately evaluated through the ability to understand and transfer published research in these fields into creative applications, recreating or mutating established research results, projects, or works to the specific interests of a student’s research area(s). We will examine exemplary methods and projects in diverse practices of computational art, music, video games, information visualization, web-based media, responsive architecture, etc., including the examination of landmark texts and projects in the history of digital media, computational arts and culture, addressing the continual overlap between artistic and scientific practices. </p>
<h2 id="format">Format</h2>
<p>Every resource will be online at or linked from <a href="http://alicelab.world/digm5010/">this website</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Due to the pandemic, course meetings will be held via Zoom every Wednesday morning, and will be recorded and uploaded for asynchronous review as soon as possible.</li>
<li>These meetings will include lecture material, discussion based on readings and related works, as well as coding or other algorithmic reconstructions, sharing work, and group discussion.</li>
<li>You are expected to make in response, and to show what you have both in class and by posting to an online journal. </li>
<li>You will need access to a computer (Mac/Windows) and headphones at minimum. </li>
<li>We will look at a variety of software through the course. </li>
</ul>
<p><em>Attendance to the Zoom sessions is highly recommended of course, given the importance of critical discussion on the development of your studies in the program and your research/research-creation; but if you are expecting challenges in attending all times please do not worry. Having the sessions recorded alleviates some inevitable challenges of the pandemic situation, and moreover allows some time to review any material that may have seemed to fly too fast.  You are all coming from different backgrounds, this is also inevitable.</em></p>
<h3 id="assignments">Assignments</h3>
<p><a href="assignments.html">See detailed assignment instructions here</a></p>
<ul>
<li>Your weekly practice-study work and other activities as documented in the online journal will account for <strong>40%</strong> of the final grade. </li>
<li>In addition, each of you will focus on a specific research topic (chosen in consultation of the instructor, ideally intersecting with one of <a href="pdf/DCA_theme_2020-2021.pdf">this year&#39;s curatorial themes</a>) to develop a new project, whose goal is to functionally reproduce and/or interestingly mutate work from the research community and literature. It implies a more significant project than the weekly practice work, but it could be a continuation of one of them.<ul>
<li>It will be grounded through an extensive literature review (<strong>20%</strong>),</li>
<li>will demonstrate your foundational computational literacy and ability to understand and transfer research into creative applications (<strong>20%</strong>),</li>
<li>and will be documented in a research paper with scholarly citations suitable to submit to conferences or other appropriate venues (<strong>20%</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note: The <a href="https://gradstudies.yorku.ca/current-students/regulations/courses-grading/">grading scheme for graduate study at York</a> is as follows: 90+ A+ (exceptional), 85+ A (excellent), 80+ A- (high), 75+ B+ (highly satisfactory), 70+ B (satisfactory), 60+ C (conditional), &lt;60 F (fail) or I (incomplete).</em></p>

<h3 id="2020-digital-media-curatorial-theme">2020 Digital Media Curatorial Theme</h3>
<p><a href="pdf/DCA_theme_2020-2021.pdf">-:: Invisibility :: Complexity :: Resistance :: Intentionality ::-</a>)</p>
<p>We are seeking work that responds to the theme Invisibility, Complexity, Resistance, Intentionality (see below) for an online exhibition of works to be presented during the week of December 14th, 2020. Works can be works you created in the past, or are planning to have completed by the end of the term. It is okay if they have been exhibited in the past already. We are open to proposals that challenge the online medium as a format for presentation and encourage alternative ways of viewing, including AR, VR, interactive, or unconventional presentations of work. </p>
<p>Submission process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Expression of Interest, we request an expression of interest be sent to the Department of Computational Arts chair by November 25th. The expression of interest should include:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Working title</li>
<li>Name(s)</li>
<li>A one paragraph description of the work</li>
<li>Any special technologies needed to present the work (video, audio, VR, AR, etc.)</li>
</ul>
<p>This step is not required, but this will help in the planning of the exhibition and facilitation of your work, and will greatly increase your chances of having the work shown.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Deadline to Submit work - December 9th (hard deadline) to Department of Computational Arts chair. This should be an updated and finalized version of the expression of interest:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>Title</li>
<li>Name(s)</li>
<li>A one paragraph description of the work</li>
<li>Any special technologies needed to present the work (video, audio, VR, AR, etc.)</li>
<li>Link to the materials</li>
</ul>
