<p>Thursdays, 1.30pm-4.30pm, Fall 2023, Fine Arts building room ACW 103</p>
<p><strong>Instructor:</strong> <a href="https://ampd.yorku.ca/profile/graham-wakefield/">Graham Wakefield</a> grrrwaaa a t york u do t ca</p>
<p><strong>Hello and welcome!</strong></p>
<h2 id="what-is-digm-5010-foundations">What is DIGM 5010 &quot;Foundations&quot;?</h2>
<p><strong>Synopsis:</strong> The purpose of Foundations is to equip and assist students to undertake <strong>graduate-level research</strong> in <strong>Digital Media</strong>. </p>
<p>DIGM5010 is foundational core course in the <a href="https://www.yorku.ca/gradstudies/digitalmedia/">Digital Media Graduate Program</a> (MA/MSc/PhD), co-organized by the <a href="https://computationalarts.ampd.yorku.ca">Department of Computational Arts</a> in the School of the Arts, Media, Performance &amp; Design, and the department of <a href="https://lassonde.yorku.ca/eecs/">Electrical Engineering and Computer Science</a> in the Lassonde School of Engineering, York University.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;The Graduate Program in Digital Media provides highly qualified students with the opportunity to do specialised hybrid research work in a program that uniquely combines computational science and artistic practices. Work in digital media focuses on a broad range of current and emerging forms of digitally supported media, with applications that range from computer games to interactive art.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The Digital Media graduate program&#39;s academic objectives include promotion of an interdisciplinary approach to computational art-making and technology development, providing students with 21st century “real-world” skills in tandem with research acumen. To work and conduct research in this area means skillfully bridging literacies in art, science and engineering practices. </p>
</blockquote>
<p>Developing these research literacies is what DIGM5010 is all about. </p>
<p>The goals of the <em>Foundations</em> course are therefore:</p>
<ul>
<li>to learn the essential methodological skills of graduate-level research in areas of digital media and computational arts</li>
<li>to develop deep understanding and a real feel for computation as a creative medium, </li>
<li>to develop the skills to attain literacy in mathematical, theoretical, and computational bases as they intersect with worlds of digital art-making,</li>
<li>to be able to adequately place your research within a larger network of relations and lineages, and to be able to articulate its relevance and identify its values in context.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>being aware of the broad range of the field along with its nearer and farther histories, narrow and broader presents, and implicated or possible futures,</p>
</li>
<li><p>being able to find, read, and understand the languages through which research is articulated, in both theoretical and practical terms, </p>
</li>
<li><p>being able to create work across of a broad range of digital media that is effective and/or innovative.</p>
<p>Establishing these foundations is ultimately evaluated through the potential to understand, transfer, and extend published research in these fields into new creative applications, recreating or mutating established research results, projects, or works to the specific interests of your research area(s) and creative domain(s). </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><em>(Reading, writing, making!)</em></p>
<p><strong>Format and evaluation</strong> </p>
<p>Each weekly meeting will vary in format, but always at the heart is the discussion between all of us. This isn&#39;t a course with a static syllabus of material -- it is an adaptive living system. </p>
<p>In the early part of the course the instructor may bring lecture material or assign readings or research tasks; and we will often dive into collectively coding or algorithmically reconstructing and reinterpreting work drawn from the literature, nestling theory in practice. You are also expected to bring work to share, <strong>making things</strong> in response to our discussions and course topic. You should be keeping your notes, studies and practices documented in a <strong>public journal</strong>. (Class participation, making and journalling make up the first 25% of the course grade.)</p>
<p>As this goes on, each of you will develop a focus on a specific topic to research in depth, leading to a project documented in a research paper. The project&#39;s goal is to functionally reproduce and/or interestingly mutate work from the research community and literature. </p>
<ul>
<li>It will be grounded through an <strong>extensive literature review</strong> (25%),</li>
<li>will demonstrate your foundational computational literacy and ability to understand and transfer research into creative applications (25%),</li>
<li>and will be documented in <strong>a research paper</strong> with scholarly citations <strong>suitable to submit to conferences or other appropriate venues</strong> (25%).</li>
</ul>
<p>We will go through draft processes and a simulated conference submission and review procedure later in the course to help understand academic research structures and refine your work. In the past years, some students have also been successful in submitting their final papers to real academic conferences.</p>
<p><strong>Online resources</strong></p>
<p>Almost everything about this course will be linked from <a href="https://alicelab.world/digm5010">https://alicelab.world/digm5010</a> -- bookmark this URL!</p>
<p>Previously we have also used a Microsoft Teams account for sharing file materials etc., but I have found it somewhat unreliable/unstable and I am open to alternatives if there are good suggestions.</p>
<p><strong>Remote participation</strong></p>
<p>Regardless whether we are meet in person or remotely, I usually prefer to open a Zoom session for my classes, and use share screen for the most part. </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://yorku.zoom.us/j/92512579632?pwd=c3FPSitZQlZIelQ2dC9CeE1RU0tnUT09">Zoom meeting (same link every week)</a></li>

</ul>
<p>I normally also record all sessions and share recordings with the course participants (so long as no participants have objections to this), as I have heard that it has been useful for many students to be able to review sessions after class hours, including when, due to factors outside their control, they could not attend in class time. <em>Synchronous attendance is highly recommended given the importance of critical discussion on the development of your studies in the program and your research/research-creation; but if you are expecting challenges in attending all times please do not worry. Having the sessions recorded alleviates some inevitable challenges of the graduate situation, and moreover allows some time to review any material if it seemed to fly too fast. You are all coming from different backgrounds so this is also inevitable.</em></p>
<hr>
<p><em>Note: The <a href="https://gradstudies.yorku.ca/current-students/regulations/courses-grading/">grading scheme for graduate study at York</a> is as follows: 90+ A+ (exceptional), 85+ A (excellent), 80+ A- (high), 75+ B+ (highly satisfactory), 70+ B (satisfactory), 60+ C (conditional), &lt;60 F (fail) or I (incomplete).</em></p>

<p><strong>Hello and welcome!</strong></p>
<p>We are in a program of digital media, co-run by computational arts and computer science. Art &amp; science as &quot;two cultures&quot;, meeting through a cybernetic medium of computation. </p>
<p>But perhaps &quot;meeting&quot; is too gentle a word. Sometimes it feels like a tectonic collision. To discover something new, we cannot follow a single path. Collisions between trajectories derail and open into new possibilities, that wouldn&#39;t be found if you only followed trend lines or deductive trails. </p>
<p>So, be comfortable to get out of your comfort zone. Learn from each other. It&#39;s OK to be awkward. Children are the most awkward, and the fastest learners, so let us be children again from time to time -- so long as we work hard at it! </p>
<p>So for example, what does &quot;computation&quot; mean to you?</p>

<h3 id="a-question">A question.</h3>
<p>Take some time to think about this: </p>
<ul>
<li>Why did you want to study in the Digital Media program -- why do you want to dedicate several precious years of your life to research in computational art &amp; science -- what does this mean for you? Is there a great risk, or a great unseen opportunity, in the computational/digital media world -- present and future -- one that also speaks to you?</li>

<li>I suggest a brief (~100 words) of your background and the key words/ideas/questions for your work, with representative images/video etc. </li>
<li>You can include a more formal bio, or artist statement, or something more informal about the inspirations that brought you to the program.</li>

<p>I said in class we should look at others’ Masters &amp; PhD theses/dissertations for inspiration. Here’s the Masters thesis of Golan Levin, from when he was a student at MIT. He is now a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and a key figure in the Art &amp; Code community. There’s a lot to draw from this thesis, both theoretically and practically. Have a good read and bring some thoughts and questions for next week:

<h3 id="computational-sketching">Computational sketching</h3>
<p>A futorologist said to me: to understand the future, we must go much further into the past; to see patterns that recur and trajectories behind the present. However this doesn&#39;t mean entering the future through a rear-view mirror (McLuhan&#39;s warning); it is to understand the language and concepts we see the world in today, and see their gaps and limitations. So it can be helful sometimes to step into the shoes of those that have gone before, to see how we ended up here, and what we may have lost or missed along the way. </p>
<p>Take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maeda">John Maeda</a>, the designer &amp; MIT Media Lab professor, who pioneered reactive graphics in the era of the Macintosh and CD-ROM. </p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Design By Numbers (John Maeda, 1999)</strong><br>&quot;Drawing by hand, using pencil on paper, is undisputedly the most natural means for visual expression. When moving on to the world of digital expression, however, the most natural means is not pencil and paper, but rather, computation. Today, many people strive to combine the traditional arts with the computer, and while they may succeed at producing a digitally empowered version of their art, they are not producing true digital art. True digital art embodies the core characteristics of the digital medium, which cannot be replicated in any other.</p>
<p>&quot;Computation is intrinsically different from existing media because it is the only medium where the material and the process for shaping the material coexiist in the same entity: numbers. The only other medium where a similar phenomenon occurs is pure thought. It naturally follows that computational media could eventually present the rare opportunity to express a conceptual art that is not polluted by textual or other visual representation. This exciting future is still at least a decade or two away. For the moment, we are forced to settle with society&#39;s current search for true meaning in an enhanced, interactive version of the art that we have always known.&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Maeda studied with Muriel Cooper and Paul Rand, and redefined the use of electronic media as a tool for expression by combining computer programming with traditional artistic technique, which helped lay the groundwork for interactive motion graphics as seen on the web today.</p>
<p>Other key insights from Maeda&#39;s interactive graphics explorations:</p>
<ul>
<li>the most <strong>interesting</strong> pixels on the screen are the mouse</li>
<li>the mouse represents not just <strong>space</strong> but also <strong>time</strong> -- use it</li>
</ul>
<p>Maeda&#39;s courses and research in the Aesthetics &amp; Computation group at MIT inspired a whole generation of creative coders. He taught Casey Reas and Ben Fry, and his <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_By_Numbers">Design By Numbers</a> software was the precursor of their Processing (and thence <a href="https://p5js.org/">P5.js</a>). </p>
<p>Maeda&#39;s courses challenged students to rethink the medium from its most basic elements. A typical assignment:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Given a point in space over a finite rectangular area, create a parametric drawing that illustrates repetition, variety, or rhythm. <a href="https://acg.media.mit.edu/courses/mas964/presentation/panels.html">MAS 964 P</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Golan Levin was one of Maeda&#39;s students, and went on to focus specifically on the creation of audiovisual instruments, responding directly to Maeda&#39;s project. (For example, look at Curly and <a href="http://www.flong.com/texts/reports/report_yellowtail/">Yellowtail</a>.) He is now a professor at Carnegie Mellon University, and a key figure in the Art &amp; Code community. There’s a lot to draw from this thesis, both theoretically and practically. <a href="http://www.flong.com/archive/texts/publications/thesis/index.html">http://www.flong.com/archive/texts/publications/thesis/index.html</a> -- what were your thoughts and questions after reading this?</p>

**Make:** Mutate [the code we build in class](https://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/bGRgJMr?editors=0010). Can you bring in more behaviour that extends or mutates drawings using the space and time of the mouse, as Maeda indicated? Can you "create a parametric drawing that illustrates repetition, variety, or rhythm"? Or can you introduce randomness in a way that increases interest? (What is an interesting random program?)

### Week 1

[Introductions](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1wTLZmtzhs499XpWeVgWC-YsCW5471OH7yRfoWykEeNI)

Sharing code sketches from last week. Curly paths.

Implementing [Vehicles](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nUFDBRNpvKXp3-JiYwBIuN0a55T4vb-Y). Geometry, vectors (see [canvas, vectors, matrices](https://github.com/worldmaking/worldmaking.github.io/wiki/JS-Canvas,-Vector,-Matrix-etc.-notes)), forces. 

**Do:** Register for a free account on [Github](https://github.com). Or, you can sign up for the free [Github education developer pack](https://education.github.com/pack) using your Yorku email address. Set up your online journal using Github markdown.

**Make:** Extend / mutate [the code we built in class](https://codepen.io/grrrwaaa/pen/mdwqLqX?editors=0010) 

**Read:** [Papert, Seymour A. Mindstorms (Excerpts)](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nUFDBRNpvKXp3-JiYwBIuN0a55T4vb-Y)

**Zoom:** [Recording](https://yorku.zoom.us/rec/share/jlIIbibCktVGhuoXFmtrLO8jm0fQoF3Aw1Vs0iXyQSi7xc8QrEpIOgpeuu3abNxK.NGk1HC0078BpRVS4)

### Online Journal & Practice Studies

You will create an online journal. If you set up a github repository, you can use the **wiki** feature as a very simple, markdown-flavoured online note taker; or simply create markdown files in the github repository itself. 

Every week, please post an update on your journal, capturing the work you have been doing. The journal as a whole will serve as a documentation of your development in the course. For practice based work, posts should include video, screenshots, embedded scripts, links to github code, or some other concete material. Posts don't need to be long, but should focus on key questions and/or insights discovered along the way. What surprised you? Did you surprise yourself? What are the key challenges you found? We will bring these into the discussion every week. 

This weekly post should include practice studies, such as links to (or embeds of) Codepen scripts. Every week I will share some prompts for these studies. These studies can be relatively simple but should demonstrate something you have learned or document an investigation you have made. Make, make make!

As the course progresses, this journal will capture your progress in development towards the major assignments, which will also be added to the journal. 

-----
### Week 2

[What is research](research.html)?

Research step 1: survey the field / [literature review](#literature-review-1)

[From Vehicles to Mindstorms](vehicles.html)

Sharing code sketches (drawing, vehicles)

[**Zoom recording**](https://yorku.zoom.us/rec/share/DPZrN3q7kWcU6weYwy_n_qQxBMh2s_ck-SRUeEgJTbGsB4kGydGFQSH1C3uZ9ZXv.Uy0rj9H84_W1jUAu) 

Please remember to **email me** with a link to your online journal, including the sketches and notes taken so far, and your literature review/reading list as you develop it!

### Literature Review 1

You will investigate a **topic** that ideally intersects this year's topic/theme (AI) with something of value to your own research goals. Good research always begins by seeking out key papers and other relevant research resources. 
  - Some investigative tips:
    - Use Wikipedia to identify **keywords or terms**, questions and issues, foundational publications and controversies, etc. This can also help to make your search more narrow/specific. Look for the edges of a body of research. Wikipedia is an excellent network of conceptual nodes (but also a potential rabbithole). But remember that it is an encyclopedia, and should be used mainly as a guide map.
    - Use these terms and publications in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/) and other academic search engines to find for papers that address the questions and issues. Follow `cited by` and `related articles` trails to find new leads. Aim to find the most significant (qualitatively & quantitatively) papers. You should be aiming for a collection of 25-50 potentially interesting papers on the topic at this point. 
    - At the same time, look for conferences or journals that are more specific to your topic, and see if they have collections of proceedings online to browse through. 
    - Not all papers are available as PDFs online. You might be able to find them via [York Libraries](https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/bbl/e-resources/) or also communities like [ResearchGate](https://www.researchgate.net/), but do not let this roadblock your progress -- find alternatives to work from instead.
    - At this point you may be able to formulate a first draft of a title of the topic or area, perhaps even a key question or problem statement; but don't worry at this stage if you haven't yet.
  - Collect this list as a **Reading List**, formatted with MLA, APA or Chicago style as you prefer (but keep it consistent) -- again, Scholar can help source these, but be aware that not all entries are complete. Any non-academic/non-paper references may need special citation styles (e.g. URLs, published films or audio recordings, etc.)
  - Post the results into your journal:
    - The specific topic title or
    - The keywords or search terms
    - The research question/problem statement/abstract
    - Your initial Reading List

- [York off-campus library access](https://www.library.yorku.ca/web/ask-services/printing-and-computing/computing/off-campus-access/)
- [York VPN links](http://www.yorku.ca/computing/vpn-choice.html)

### Literature Review 2 

- From your reading list, select at least 8 of them to study in more careful detail as you create an **Annotated Bibliography**. 
  - Use skimming/speed reading and organization to identify those that are most interesting or most worthy of more detailed review; and which would constitute an adquate treatment of the topic. 
  - Aim for diversity. Avoid using the same authors for the majority of the selection. Include distinct and opposing viewpoints if possible. 
  - Use primary sources where possible (in particular avoid blog posts, news articles, etc.), unless the secondary source adds a significant new idea (in which case you may want to cite both).
  - Not everything has to be an academic paper, but ensure that at least 75% of your references are academic publications (conference articles, journal articles, etc.). 
- Once your list is shortened, perform a deep read of each one, taking notes as you go. The annotation for each paper could typically be 200-500 words. 
  - I recommend highlighting PDFs but taking notes in a separate plain text document. 
  - Don't note everything, focus on what the key points are to get a condensed overview of the whole paper. (A well-written paper makes one main point per paragraph, and not all points are significant.)
    - Distinguish clearly between 
      - what is a summary of the paper, 
      - what is a quotation from the paper (use quotation marks), 
      - and what is your own thought in response (you could use (parentheses) or [square brackets] to indicate these). 
    - Note page numbers in the text document as you take notes. 
  - See [York SPARK's guide to annotated bibliographies here](https://spark.library.yorku.ca/wp-content/themes/glendonits-spark-20151125/resources/Annotated%20Bibliography%20Overview.pdf). 
  - However, unlike the format and examples in that guide, I support and encourage bullet-point style summaries.
  - I also encourage you to copy out any specific quotations that you find significant, inspiring, or which neatly summarize the authors' points. 
- After deep note-taking on each paper, read them again with your notes, and correct any mistakes or misunderstandings, amend your analyses, and note any new thoughts. This is your **annotation** for each paper. 
- Post the results into your journal:
  - The specific topic title or
  - The keywords or search terms
  - The research question/problem statement/abstract
  - Your initial Reading List
  - Your final Annotated Bibliography
  - Any meta-commentary on observations you found while researching the topic that are not specific to any one paper -- in particular, did you find a "gap" in the treatment of the topic that could be an important avenue for your own work?

For example, [here's](https://alicelab.world/digm5010/vehicles.html#annotated-notes) my own annotated bibliography notes on Seymour Papert's Mindstorms.

### Video Tutorial

Research is about *sharing*. Sometimes, that requires sharing *how*. 

1. Create a video-based tutorial (roughly 10-20mins) to introduce a technical topic.
    - It could be an introduction to a platform we are not covering in class
    - or an exploration of a library/API or SDK etc. available for one of our platforms
    - or alternatively, it could be a tutorial on a technique or algorithm or mechanism or a part of mathematics etc.
2. Whichever you choose, it should cover both of: 
    - introducing the key concepts, the unusual and interesting parts, and related work
    - deep-dive developing a demonstration (coding a sketch) from the ground up, explaining via voiceover what you are doing at each step and why. 
3. You are welcome to use any screen-recording tool. Zoom is OK, Camtasia is pretty fancy, OBS is very powerful. Whatever you use, I recommend doing a few takes. Sometimes the first take is the best, sometimes the third. You are welcome to edit them together if it makes sense. But don't lose time making it 'slick' -- that's not the point here. People like Dan Shiffman or 3Blue1Brown do make beautiful videos but the most important part is that they convey *what* is interesting/valuable/powerful/etc. about the technical system/tool/algorithm/etc by explaining *how* it works.

### Week 8

- Discussion about abstracts, final papers, and 
- Peer review preview: 
  - Sharing past reviews (and reviewing)
  - Example: SIGGRAPH Art Papers
  - [The form](https://forms.gle/pWesCCBQkeMKWX6y7)
- Video tutorials

[Final paper](#final-paper) [draft for review](#peer-review)

-----
### Week 9

- Performing & responding to peer reviews
- [The form](https://forms.gle/pWesCCBQkeMKWX6y7)is based on the real peer review format of the SIGGRAPH Art Papers section https://blog.siggraph.org/tag/art-papers/. That process was double-blind (both authors & reviewers anonymized), but since we know each other, we'll run our review single-blind (authors anonymized). Each of you will be randomly assigned up to 3 papers to review. 
- Two weeks to presentation

**[Zoom recording](https://yorku.zoom.us/rec/share/tcnLkfrrxxapfsjmWn15gcox0LM-MYQg8BQVgs3iCLqsFL82eqkj7oa1ruGgeIC1.erXQvut-v6uZlJDP)**

### Peer Review

[Reviewing research](research.html#/33)

Between week 9 and 10 we will run an 'internal review' process, emulating what is frequently done in conference submission review processes. Typically this means:

- A call for work (papers, demonstrations, artworks, panels, etc.) is made public.
- Authors submit a draft or extended abstract of a paper (or a proposal for an artwork etc.) by a certain deadline for review, usually using an online interface. 
- Reviews are most often performed "blind" or "double-blind" (that is, reviewers and authors are anonymized).
- Each draft is sent to a handful of reviewers. Members of the review body are usually made up of many previous authors at the conferene. Though a conference may have hundreds of submissions, usually reviewers only have a handful assigned to them. 
- Reviewers complete a review of the submission, usually using an online interface, by a certain deadline. Sometimes a meta-review is performed by a lead jury member of the conference to synthesize the reviews and reach a verdict on acceptance. Sometimes submissions are accepted, sometimes rejected, sometimes accepted but on different terms (e.g. long paper submission may be accepted as a short paper, with requirement to reduce length.)
- These reviews are sent back to authors, along with the accept/reject verdict. Authors of accepted papers must act upon any requirements or corrections identified by reviewers, and may follow further recommendations. Then the final submission is resubmitted with these changes by a new deadline (usually very shortly after receiving reviews).

For our purposes, you will act both as authors and reviewers: each of you will act as reviewers for the others' submissions. 

For general review guidelines, [see here](https://www.wikihow.com/Review-a-Journal-Article) and [here](https://authorservices.wiley.com/Reviewers/journal-reviewers/how-to-perform-a-peer-review/step-by-step-guide-to-reviewing-a-manuscript.html) or [here](https://www.elsevier.com/reviewers/how-to-review), or [here](https://www.springer.com/authors/manuscript+guidelines?SGWID=0-40162-6-1261021-0#:~:text=Reviews%20should%20be%20conducted%20fairly,less%20useful%20to%20your%20field.):

> "The purpose of peer review is to improve the quality of the manuscript under review, and of the material that is eventually published. Conscientious peer review is a time¬-consuming task but is essential to assure the quality of scientific journals." 
> Reviews should be conducted fairly and objectively. Personal criticism of the author is inappropriate. If the research reported in the manuscript is flawed, criticize the science, not the scientist. Criticisms should be objective, not merely differences of opinion, and intended to help the author improve his or her paper.
> Comments should be constructive and designed to enhance the manuscript. You should consider yourself the authors’ mentor. Make your comments as complete and detailed as possible. Express your views clearly with supporting arguments and references as necessary. Include clear opinions about the strengths, weaknesses and relevance of the manuscript, its originality and its importance to the field. Specific comments that cite line numbers are most helpful. 
> Begin by identifying the major contributions of the paper. What are its major strengths and weaknesses, and its suitability for publication? Please include both general and specific comments bearing on these questions, and emphasize your most significant points. Support your general comments, positive or negative, with specific evidence.
> Is the aim clearly stated? Do the title, abstract, key words, introduction, and conclusions accurately and consistently reflect the major point(s) of the paper? Is the writing concise, easy to follow, and interesting, without repetition?
> Are the methods appropriate, sound, current, and described clearly enough that the work could be repeated by someone else? Is the research ethical and have the appropriate approvals/consent been obtained? Are appropriate analyses used? Are they sufficiently justified and explained? Are statements of significance justified? Are results supported by data? Are any of . the results counterintuitive? Are the conclusions supported by the data presented?
> Are the references cited the most appropriate to support the manuscript? Are citations provided for all assertions of fact not supported by the data in this paper? Are any key citations missing? 
> Should any portions of the paper should be expanded, condensed, combined, or deleted? 

As a structure, we will base our [review form](https://forms.gle/pWesCCBQkeMKWX6y7) on materials as used by the SIGGRAPH Art Papers review body.

### Final Paper

1. The final paper can continue from the Literature Review. You may incorporate documenting & contextualize your practice studies or one of your artworks. You could write a 'white paper' on a technique. You might re-implement a known research paper, and analyze the results. Or you might discuss more deeply ideas encountered in the bibliography. Perhaps pen a manifesto. 
  - Find a few other papers online that have similar focus, and analyze their structure as a guide.
  - Find related conferences/symposia/journals/etc. to contrast other papers as well as submission and review criteria. 
  - You should identify at least one conference/festival/other appropriate venue to submit your research or research-creation. Investigate papers submitted to this in past years, and the submission requirements and review criteria. 
  - Document these findings in your journal.
2. The format will be a very modern, online-first academic article. That is, one designed to be read online, with at least some active components, rather than primarily on paper. The notion of publishing in academia has been rapidly changing, and these changes are accelerating under pandemic conditions.
  - See [https://www.pubpub.org](https://www.pubpub.org) for an example of a modern online-first collaborative publishing venue. Many conferences in recent years have moved over to this format (e.g. NIME, ICLC). 
  - See [https://distill.pub](https://distill.pub) for an example of a modern, web-based peer-reviewed journal with embedded visualizations and interactive components. 
  - See [https://jar-online.net](https://jar-online.net) for a different example more focused on art theory & practice.
  - Alternatively, create your own using github, github-pages, html5/css/js, markdown/pandoc, D3.js, webgl or similar. 
  - Whichever platform is used, the paper should meet academic standards of relevance, clarity of writing, structure, balanced and evidence-based argument, critical thinking, and appropriate level and kinds of academic references. 
3. Post your final paper online -- either inside or linked from your journal.
